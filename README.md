Minimalist Digital Clock: An elegant design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I present my project for a minimalist digital clock, developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Inspired by clean, modern aesthetics, this watch offers a stylish and functional alternative to traditional digital watches.

With a simple and intuitive design, the clock displays the hour, minutes and seconds in a clear, easy-to-read digital format. The neutral color palette and minimalist typography ensure a sophisticated and discreet appearance, adapting to any environment.

The minimalist digital clock is a versatile and customizable design that can be adapted to each user's needs and preferences. With its modern and functional aesthetic, this project demonstrates the potential of combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create elegant and interactive interfaces.
